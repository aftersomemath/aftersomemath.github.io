One day, I would like to teach. This page is a reminder of that.

I think that teaching is the most valuable thing someone can do for another professional, student, or peer. For three years of my undergrad, I was a leader in Pitt's <a href="pittras.org">Robotics and Automation Society</a>. I ran several project teams and advised leaders of other teams. Answering technical questions was a daily activity.
