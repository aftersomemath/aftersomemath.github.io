One day, I would like to teach. This page is a reminder of that.

I think that teaching is the most valuable investment. For three years of my undergrad, I was a leader in Pitt's <a href="http://pittras.org">Robotics and Automation Society</a>. I ran several project teams and advised leaders of other teams. Through this experience, I learned that time spent teaching was much more impactful than time spent working.
