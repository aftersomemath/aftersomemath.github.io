Teaching is the most valuable investment. For three years of undergrad, I lead project teams in Pitt's <a href="http://pittras.org">Robotics and Automation Society</a>. This experience made clear that time spent teaching can be much more impactful than time spent working. As a result, I enjoy serving as a TA.
