One day, I would like to teach. This page is a reminder of that. One day it may contain course listings.

I think that teaching is the most valuable thing someone can do for another professional, student, or peer. For three years of my undergrad, I was a leader in Pitt's <a href="pittras.org">Robotics and Automation Society</a>. I ran several project teams, and thus answered technical questions almost daily. By doing this, I encouraged a love of robotics in my peers, some have even gone on to pursue careers in robotics. Answering questions helped keep me motivated, I wanted to be better so that I could answer questions better.

This experience, is why I want to teach one day.
