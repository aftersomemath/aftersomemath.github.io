I am an Electrical Engineering undergradate at the University of Pittsburgh, graduating in December of 2018. My interests are in the agressive and robust control of autonomous systems. My long-term goal is to apply this research to space systems. I am currently looking for a Ph.D. advisor in this area.

Small autonomous sytems, particularly flying ones, will have significant impact on the world. However, there is a significant deficit in the ability to control such systems in a robust and useful manner. Solving this problem is critical to making aerial systems useful in everyday life.

I am currently researching <a href="/projects/hitl-cubesat/">low-cost CubeSat mission simulation<a>.

My most significant project was being a leader of Pitt's <a href="http://www.aerialroboticscompetition.org">International Aerial Robotics Competition</a> team. The team was the top performer of Mission 7 at the American Venue two years in row. Both years, the team received the Best System Design award and in 2018, <a href="http://pittras.org/assets/misc/iarc-technical-paper-2018.pdf">Best Technical Paper</a>. Check out <a href="/projects/iarc-mission-7/">this page</a> for photos and videos.

An overview of my work (particularly making drones hit moving targets) can be found on the <a href="/projects/">projects</a> page. Additionally, some of the projects were the subject of <a href="/publications/">papers or presentations</a>.
