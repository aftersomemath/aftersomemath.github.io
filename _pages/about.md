I am an Electrical Engineering undergradate at the University of Pittsburgh, graduating in December of 2018. My interests are in the control of unmanned air vehicles (UAV) and CubeSats.

I believe that small autonomous sytems, particularly flying ones, will have significant impact on the world. However, there is a significant deficit in the ability to control these systems in a robust and useful manner in unstructured environments. Solving this problem is critical to making aerial systems useful in everyday life.

My most significant project was being a leader of Pitt's <a href="http://www.aerialroboticscompetition.org">International Aerial Robotics Competition</a> team. The team was the top performer of Mission 7 at the American Venue two years in row. Both years, the team received the Best System Design award and in 2018, <a href="http://pittras.org/assets/misc/iarc-technical-paper-2018.pdf">Best Technical Paper</a>.

I have completed many robotics projects and worked on or lead several successful project teams. Please check out my work on my <a href="projects/">Projects</a> page. Additionally, I have been an author of some <a href="publications/">Technical Reports</a> related to these projects.
