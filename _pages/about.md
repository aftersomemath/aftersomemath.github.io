Fast and small robots, particularly flying ones, have numerous applications. However, the state-of-the-art achieves limited robustness and agility when restricted to onboard sensing. To solve this, my research seeks bioinspired perception algorithms that can be analyzed with control theory.

I work with the <a href="https://prg.cs.umd.edu/">Perception and Robotics Group</a> and am advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7QmEsOwAAAAJ">Prof. Yiannis Aloimonos</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=0gEOJSEAAAAJ">Dr. Cornelia Ferm√ºller</a>.

Currently, I am particularly interested in:
* Control using minimal egomotion representations
* Non-metric representations of environment
* Optical illusions that can be used to trick computer vision
* Early neural mechanisms responsible for perception
* State estimation utilizing specialized motion

Prior to graduate school, I studied electrical engineering at the University of Pittsburgh. There, I led an <a href="http://pittras.org/projects/IARC/">award winning aerial robotics team<a/>. After graduating, I worked as an engineer for <a href="https://carnegierobotics.com/">Carnegie Robotics LLC</a>. These experiences made me passionate about developing robust perception for robots participating in everyday life. 

In response to COVID-19, I am working with <a href="https://ece.umd.edu/clark/faculty/366/Gilmer-L-Blankenship">Prof. Gilmer Blankenship</a> on a creative revision of <a href="https://ece.umd.edu/course-schedule/course/ENEE408I">ENEE408I: Autonomous Control of Interacting Robots</a> for Fall 2020.

The best way to contact me is through <a href="mailto:lburner@umd.edu">email</a>. I enjoy answering questions!
