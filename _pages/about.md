My research interests are in provably robust navigation of autonomous systems. In particular, I am interested in how a robots perception of the world is influenced during a manuever. By coupling this information with expected control system performance I am interested in providing quantifiable estimates of the chances of success or failure of a manuever through a cluttered environment.

Small autonomous sytems, particularly flying ones, will have significant impact on the world. However, there is a significant deficit in the ability to control such systems in a robust and useful manner due to inadequacies of onboard perception. Solving this problem is critical to making aerial systems useful in everyday life.

Prior to beginning my studies with UMD I studied electrical engineering at the University of Pittsburgh and later worked as a software engineer at <a href="https://carnegierobotics.com/">Carnegie Robotics LLC</a>.

I was a founder and leader of Pitt's <a href="http://www.aerialroboticscompetition.org">International Aerial Robotics Competition</a> team from 2016 till 2018. The team was the top performer of Mission 7 at the American Venue two years in row. Both years, the team received the Best System Design award and in 2018, <a href="http://pittras.org/assets/misc/iarc-technical-paper-2018.pdf">Best Technical Paper</a>. Check out <a href="/projects/iarc-mission-7/">this page</a> for photos and videos.

An overview of my work (particularly making drones hit moving targets) can be found on the <a href="/projects/">projects</a> page. Additionally, some of the projects were the subject of <a href="/publications/">papers or presentations</a>.
