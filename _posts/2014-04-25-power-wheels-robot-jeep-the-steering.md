Back in December I picked up a power wheels jeep at the local toy store. It was sitting as an advertisement out front. No batteries, but the motors were still good. I asked the owner if I could purchase it to make a robot and they gave it to me for free.

Since then I have been trying, off and on, to make a power wheels robot. The problem has been the steering. Many different things were tried but all of them turned out to be too weak, too power hungry, or just plain dumb.

## Breakthrough

Then I tried a new method. It is hard to explain what I did in words so take a look at the video below.

## Going forward

Now the that steering is both functional and strong I can move onto designing the electronics for the Jeep Bot. Keep an eye out for more posts about the build process!
