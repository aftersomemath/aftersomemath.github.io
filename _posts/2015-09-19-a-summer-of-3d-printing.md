As the end of the Spring 2015 semester drew to a close, I became fascinated with 3D Printing. In University, 3D printers are common, Makerbots seem to be everywhere. I wanted my own printer to be able to experiment with over the summer, however I definitely couldn't afford a makerbot.

TL;DR: This is the kind of things my printer can print.

Some google-fu lead me to <a href="http://reprap.org/" target="_blank">http://reprap.org/</a>. I read a lot of different wiki articles about the different RepRap models that were popular and decided to get the <a href="http://folgertech.com/collections/3d-printer-full-kits/products/folger-tech-reprap-prusa-i3-clear-frame-full-3d-printer-kit-ramps-gt2" target="_blank">Folgertech Prusa i3 kit</a> that had recently become popular on Ebay. I felt that a kit was the best way to go since while I understood a lot of theory about 3D Printers, I did not know enough to go and source all my parts without making mistakes.

I bought the printer the week before finals. Thankfully, I shipped it to my home address so I could not be distracted while I studied for school. As soon as I got home, I put it together.

My father was pretty sure it would catch on fire, thankfully it didn't. My first 3D Printed object was a Black ABS Marvin.

It was perfect, and I would soon go on  to make better prints. But I'll never forget the first one. The excitement I felt when I realized I could make almost any object I wanted was something else. That excitement fueled my attempts to make the printer better over the course of the summer.

My upgrades included upgrading to a Wade's Extruder combined with an e3D v6, putting an autolevel probe on the hotend so that I didn't have to spend time leveling the print bed, and upgrading my print bed to use a PEI build surface to avoid warping when printing ABS.

Currently, my printer sits on a table in my room at school. I use it to print things for the Robotics and Automation Society which is a University sponsored club I participate in. Additionally, I have an online store setup at <a href="https://www.3dhubs.com/Pittsburgh/hubs/levi" target="_blank">3Dhubs.com</a> that brings me occasional print jobs. I use the money to buy more plastic and upgrades for my printer.
