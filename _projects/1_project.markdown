This project started in August of 2018 with the goal of working towards an academic constellation of free-flying CubeSats. The first step is creating a low-cost hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform. A gimbal mounted CubeSat model containing realistic hardware and reaction wheels enables rapid software iteration and testing. Usage will help minimize risks associated with first-time academic CubeSat programs because it reduces difficutly in performing in unit, functional, and system testing of software.

Collaborating with Christopher Manderino under Dr. Alan George through the <a href="https://nsf-shrec.org/">NSF Center for Space High-Performance and Reconfigurable Computing</a>.
