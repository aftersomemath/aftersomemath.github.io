From 2015-2016 I co-led a team of 10 students with Aaron Miller to create a robotic rover. The robot featured dual-gimbaled cameras and a web interface. The underside of the robot was covered in individually addressable RGB LED's.

Unfortunately all video footage of the final versions of the robot (as pictured) has been lost!
