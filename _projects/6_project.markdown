From 2015-2016 I co-led a line follower team of 15 students with Aaron Miller to create a line follower capable of 1 m/s translation while navigating 90 degree corners.

The robot incorporated a custom circuit board, custom cascaded PID control, and implemented independent velocity controllers for each of 4 wheels.
